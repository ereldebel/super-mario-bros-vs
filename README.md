# Super Mario Bros Vs.
Un upgrade to [my second Unity and C# project](https://github.com/ereldebel/super-mario-bros).
In this project I took all I did with the _Super Mario bros._ recreation and tried making something different from it.
The result is a local Player Vs. Player (Mario Vs. Luigi) race to the top of the castle.

All script were written in C# by me.

The game was created in the _Game Development Foundations_ course by [NotSlot](https://github.com/notslot) as part of the _Bezalel Game Development and Design Minor_ of my _Computer Science B.Sc._ in _The Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel_.

To run the game on windows run the _Windows Build/Super Mario Bros Vs.exe_ executable file.

To run the game on mac run the  _Mac Build.app_ package.

The _Source_ Directory contains all the source material.
